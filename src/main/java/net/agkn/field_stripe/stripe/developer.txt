Background
==========

The readers and writers of the raw field stripe states and values. This package 
should be considered to be a service-provider interface (SPI). It contains the 
various field stripe file encodings. The process of deriving and decoding the
states from and into records is completely divorced from the writing of those
states. New file encodings can be created without the need to understand or
change how the striping process works.

For each file encoding a IFieldStripeWriterFactory and IFieldStripeReaderFactory 
are required.


To do
=====

*  Add meta-data to each field stripe so that validation can be performed in
   the readers between what exists and what is expected.
