Field-stripe encoders tests are broken into two primary cases:

*  Repeated parents: at least one of the parents of a field is repeated
   and as a result "repeated-parent" markers are required. 
*  Non-repeated parents: none of the parents of a field is repeated. In this
   case, each value (except where preceded by a "repeated-value" marker) implies 
   a new record.

This separation was done solely to reduce the complexity of the test cases. 
Refer to the "Efficient Field-Striped, Nested Disk-backed Record Storage" document
for encoding information.
